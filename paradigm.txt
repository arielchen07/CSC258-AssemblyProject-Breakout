register $s:
1. $s0: display start address
2. $s1: ball address
3. $s2: paddle address
4. $s3: horizontal direction
5. $s4: vertical direction
6. $s5: start enable (will implement in the future)

register $t:
1. $t1 for iteartion start i=0
2. $t2 for iteration number (and for loop criterion)
3. $t3 for colors
4. $t4 for effective data in the loop
5. $t6 for nested iteration start
6. $t7 for nested iteration number
7. $t9 for destination register in slt in for loop
(take a look at the process of draw_top_wall: for reference)
