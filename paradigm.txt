use $s to store immutable data (take a look at load_save_register:)
use $t1 for iteartion start i=0
use $t2 for iteration number (and for loop criterion)
use $t3 for colors
use $t4 for effective data in the loop
use $t9 for destination register in slt in for loop
(take a look at the process of draw_top_wall: for reference)
